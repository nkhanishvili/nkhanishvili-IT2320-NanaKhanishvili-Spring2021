          <P>
            The Art Studio, Inc. was founded as a non-profit corporation in December 1983 by artists to encourage other
            artists to practice their disciplines in Southeast Texas. It was envisioned that by addressing the needs of
            artists in the process of developing their careers, The Art Studio would allow exceptional talent to remain
            in our
            region and attract other artists to the area as well. Essential to the needs of artists is a supportive
            public
            therefore community outreach has been a primary focus of The Art Studio since its conception. Providing for
            the
            most basic needs of artists, The Art Studio makes available affordable studio space and access to equipment
            for
            ceramics, painting, foundry, woodworking, and metal work. The Art Studio exhibition space is an engaging
            alternative to museums and commercial galleries, encouraging the experimental work of living artists as
            opposed to
            marketing after the commercial potential has been established. The Art Studioâ€™s education programs are an
            effective means of community outreach and another source of income for the artists.
