      The Art Studio, Inc. was founded as a non-profit corporation in December 1983 by artists to encourage other
      artists to practice their disciplines in Southeast Texas. It was envisioned that by addressing the needs of
      artists in the process of developing their careers, The Art Studio would allow exceptional talent to remain in our
      region and attract other artists to the area as well. Essential to the needs of artists is a supportive public
      therefore community outreach has been a primary focus of The Art Studio since its conception. Providing for the
      most basic needs of artists, The Art Studio makes available affordable studio space and access to equipment for
      ceramics, painting, foundry, woodworking, and metal work. The Art Studio exhibition space is an engaging
      alternative to museums and commercial galleries, encouraging the experimental work of living artists as opposed to
      marketing after the commercial potential has been established. The Art Studioâ€™s education programs are an
      effective means of community outreach and another source of income for the artists.
